### Project notes


**I’m still moving a few things into this repo.**

Originally an assignment that I intentionally overbuilt. Beyond the assignment, I used this as a sandbox and a personal project. 

This is primarily a proof of concept rather than a long-term codebase.

It runs well, though some parts of the code are rough around the edges.
